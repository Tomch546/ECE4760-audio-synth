# ECE 4760 Final Project: A digital Audio Synthesizer with RP2040

## Made by:
- Tommy Chen
- Raphael Fortuna
- Rhia Malhotra

## Summary    

We chose this project as an exploration into the field of digital-signal processing. Initially, we expected this would be a software-heavy, hardware-light project. This was preferred over something more hardware-involved. It ended up being an everything-heavy project, but we learned a lot.

It features:
- Four buttons to access the different menus
- One potentiometer slider for adjusting variables
- One rotary encoder to select what variable should be changed
- Twelve piano “keys” connected to a capacitive touch sensor module to change the frequency

## How to use
- To use our code, load the audioSynth.uf2 onto the Pico and follow the circuit instructions available under design and appendices on our website here: [ECE 4760 Final Project: A digital Audio Synthesizer with RP2040](https://pages.github.coecis.cornell.edu/tc575/tc575_rm722_raf269/index.html)
